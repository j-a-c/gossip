Tests for gossip-based dissemination for self-structuring networks

A system of nodes is created with a random amount of randomly connected nodes.
One of these nodes in the "infected" with a structure strategy. Each timestep,
a node chooses one of its known peer to exchange strategies with. The goal is
to monitor how fast strategies spread, as well as how the structure of the
network changes as random nodes are infected with new strategies over time. It
is also important to monitor the long-term effectiveness of different
strategies.
